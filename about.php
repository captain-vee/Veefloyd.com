    <p>
      When Vee first set foot on campus, he was an engineering major because he loved the idea of writing code.
      Vee's passion for coding, did not translate to engineering, however, so Vee found his true calling: economics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vee graduated from Duke University with a B.S. in economics in 2014.
      Unlike most economics majors, Vee did not have his eyes set on Wallstreet, he preffered to apply his analytical skills and strategical brainpower to marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vee has worked at a social media marketing agency and, most recently, has headed the marketing effort for a small tech company.
      During the first few months after graduation, Vee took up web development as a hobby and never looked back.
      He finally found an ejoyable way to write code.

      Vee currently lives in Durham North Carolina with his beautiful wife and their handsome boxer.
      You can catch Vee at the gym lifting heavy (unless it's leg day) or coding his latest project, guranteed to be the best thing since sliced bread.
